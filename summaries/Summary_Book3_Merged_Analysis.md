Sentiment–Trading Relationship

1. Profitability vs Sentiment
What was studied
Relationship between trader profitability (Closed PnL) and overall market emotion (Fear &
Greed).
Findings
• Median profit remains close to zero in all sentiment regimes, confirming that only a few
trades truly move overall results.
• Mean profit rises with market optimism : Neutral: ~26, Fear: ~36, Greed: ~41, Extreme
Greed: ~68.
• Win rate improves from 35% in Neutral to 47% in Extreme Greed, showing higher success
when confidence dominates.
• Risk (PnL volatility) peaks during Fear and Greed, reflecting unstable trading under
emotional pressure.
• Top 5% of trades account for most total profit, while the bottom 5% contribute smaller
losses, revealing a positive payoff asymmetry.
Takeaway
Greedy markets drive larger gains but also wider swings. Traders seem to perform best when
confidence is high yet remain exposed to sharp reversals. Sentiment amplifies performance
but doesn’t guarantee consistency.

2. Volume & Participation vs Market Sentiment
What was studied
How total traded volume and participation levels vary with market emotion.
Findings
• Trading activity surges during Fear and Extreme Fear, with daily volumes exceeding 8
million USD on average.
• Greed and Neutral phases show smaller volumes and fewer trades, suggesting calm and
reduced speculation.
• Extreme volume spikes almost always appear in fear-driven markets, aligning with panicbased activity.
• Average daily volume before a sentiment shift is nearly double normal levels, showing that
participation often increases just before the market mood changes.
Takeaway
Fear accelerates trading behavior more than Greed does. Spikes in participation signal
emotional stress in the market and can be early indicators of upcoming sentiment reversals.

3. Risk, Efficiency & Market Behavior
What was studied
How risk, volatility, and efficiency metrics behave under different sentiment conditions.
Findings
• PnL volatility stays highest during Fear and Greed, indicating traders become more
aggressive in uncertain markets.
• Risk-adjusted metrics such as Sharpe-like ratios remain inconsistent, showing limited
control over volatility.
• Trade sizes are largest in Fear phases and smaller in Greed, implying defensive
concentration versus opportunistic distribution.
• Despite higher risk, Greed phases offer slightly more stable returns compared to Fear, which delivers wide but uneven outcomes.

Takeaway:
Both Fear and Greed trigger high-risk behavior, but their patterns differ. Fear leads to
concentrated bets and uncertainty, while Greed encourages frequent, confident participation.
Overall Insight
Market emotion governs intensity, not direction.
Fear expands participation and volatility, Greed improves hit rate and consistency, and
Neutral phases keep markets quiet.
Traders can adapt by scaling exposure with sentiment: reduce leverage in fearful markets,
ride momentum cautiously in greedy ones, and stay defensive during neutral cycles.
