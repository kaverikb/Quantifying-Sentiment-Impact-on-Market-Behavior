Foundation for Merged Analysis

1. Sentiment Dataset Insights
Focus:
Understanding long-term emotional trends through the Fear & Greed Index.
Key findings:
• Sentiment values fluctuate cyclically between extreme fear and extreme greed, with stable
periods punctuated by sharp transitions.
• Fear and Greed phases occur in nearly equal proportions, creating balanced conditions for
behavioral analysis.
• Autocorrelation above 0.95 confirms persistence in emotional states. Market sentiment
doesn’t shift abruptly but evolves gradually.
• Rolling 7- and 21-day means reveal clusters of volatility, aligning with major historical
market events.
• These emotional waves form the backdrop for interpreting trader psychology: greed-driven
confidence versus fear-driven caution.
Why it matters:
This dataset defined the emotional environment of the market. The clear cyclic behavior and
regime stability suggested that trader actions could be grouped by sentiment phase, forming
the structural basis for the merged analysis later.

2. Trading Dataset Insights
Focus:
Exploring raw trading behavior: profitability, position size, and daily activity independently
from sentiment.
Key findings:
• The distribution of Closed PnL is highly skewed, with most trades near breakeven and a few
large wins or losses driving totals.
• Trade sizes vary drastically, indicating both retail and institutional activity.
• Average daily volume remains stable through late 2024, then spikes in early 2025, hinting at
external drivers such as market-wide volatility.
• Win rates hover around 40%, reflecting mixed performance and possible emotional
decision-making.
• The dataset’s scale and volatility profile make it suitable for behavioral segmentation once
emotional context is added.
Why it matters:
The trading data showed strong fluctuations in activity and outcome but lacked an emotional
reference. This motivated linking it with the sentiment dataset—to understand whether these
behavioral shifts aligned with Fear or Greed phases.

3. Transition to Merged Analysis
Analytical reasoning:
• Both datasets independently revealed cyclical structures: one emotional, one behavioral.
• The sentiment data provided a slow-moving emotional framework, while the trading data
reflected fast, reactive behavior.
• The combination aimed to explain when and why traders became more active or profitable,
using sentiment as the psychological anchor.
How it guided the next step:
The insights from Book2 clarified that studying either dataset alone was incomplete.
Sentiment captured the market’s emotional climate, and trading data captured human
response to that climate. Merging them in Book3 allowed testing alignment between emotion
and behavior & how confidence or fear translated into trading intensity, profitability, and risk.
